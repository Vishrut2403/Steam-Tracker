## What is this?

Modern gamers play across Steam, retro emulators, Minecraft, and more — making it impossible to track total playtime or analyze habits in one place. Game Vault solves that by aggregating everything into a single dashboard with GitHub-style activity heatmaps, value analytics, and smart wishlist recommendations.

## Key Features

- **Multi-platform library** — Steam, RetroAchievements, RetroArch, Minecraft, PCSX2, RPCS3, PPSSPP
- **RetroArch support** — Auto-detects games and playtime from local playlists and runtime logs across any installed core
- **HowLongToBeat integration** — Main story, main + extras, and completionist estimates on every game
- **Smart recommendations** — 0/1 knapsack algorithm scored by discount, HLTB hrs/₹ value, and your taste profile
- **Advanced analytics** — GitHub-style heatmap, session tracking, radar chart, platform distribution, price-per-hour
- **Unified journal** — Notes and progress logs for every game across all platforms
