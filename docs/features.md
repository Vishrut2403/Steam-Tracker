## HowLongToBeat Integration

Every game modal shows three time estimates fetched from HLTB:
- **Main story** — core campaign only
- **Main + extras** — campaign plus side content
- **Completionist** — full 100% run

Steam games resolve via exact appId lookup. Non-Steam games search by name via the Steam store. Data is cached in-memory per session.

> RetroArch games use ROM filenames which don't match HLTB names reliably — HLTB estimates won't show for these.

## Recommendation System

Enter a budget and the system picks the optimal combination of wishlist games using a 0/1 knapsack algorithm.

Each game is scored across four dimensions:
- **Discount** (50%) — sale percentage
- **Value** (30%) — HLTB completionist hours ÷ current price (hrs/₹)
- **Tag match** (15%) — genre overlap with your library
- **Rating match** (5%) — average rating of similar genres you've played

HLTB data for wishlist games is fetched automatically on first run and stored in the database — subsequent runs are instant.

## Journal System

Write game-specific notes and progress logs. Each entry has an optional heading and freeform text. Entries display in chronological order per game.

---

## Session Tracking

Daily playtime is recorded per game on every sync. The heatmap and analytics views are powered by this session data. Sessions are created during sync operations — not real-time.

---

## Tier List

Drag games into S / A / B / C / D tiers. Visual display with game covers.
